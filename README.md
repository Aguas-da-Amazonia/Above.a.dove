## Usage

1) install Adobe apps  
2) install Clash Verge, change mode forom System Proxy to Tun mode and Activate Tun mode  
3) add the blocklist and whitelist via URL so they auto-update in the future

if you need to install any additional Adobe app in the future, disable
Clash first, then install and finally turn Clash Verge back ON.

## Theory
there are 2 major category of hosts:
- with permanent dns names like
  
ic.adobe.io
prod.adobegenuine.com
etc.

- and random-looking dns hosts that are actually generated by a specific alghorhytm and based on experience so far the appearance of these hosts are time-coded, a dozen new appear in network traffic each day like:

pvit0rg7db.adobestats.io
qwidorfrss.adobestats.io
etc.

Blocking 
Premiere 2025 is a great example that blocking these hosts is useless

non DNS based peer-to-peer communication

why is this better than blocking with firewall?

For example in case of Acrobat Pro for Windows, it's not enough to block the main .exe, because there's an additional component the runs in the background once Acrobat is started and actively takes part in the telemetry.

it's not enought to block the main 

## A Huge Misconception about blocking

<ins>A proxy server with blocking rules is not a firewall!</ins>  
But why not?

Every proxy is focused on channeling http and https transit (port 80 and 443), but nothing else!
If an app decides to establish a connection to a remote server via port 6123 for example, then it just successfully bypassed the proxy, and guess what: Adobe apps do that!

That's the reason why a popular blocklist [a.dove.isdumb.one](https://github.com/ignaciocastro/a-dove-is-dumb) (and all others too) are filled with false positive URLs. Also, every blocklist that targets blocking domains via the /etc/hosts file is generally useless and a timed bomb - but we will get back to this later.

Let's first understand what's happening when you are blocking a certain set of domains with a proxy app like Clash, how an app behaves:

Let's say we are blocking:

0.0.0.0  ic.adobe.io  
0.0.0.0  cc-api-data.adobe.io  
0.0.0.0  fp.adobestats.io  
0.0.0.0  hbc.adobe.io  
0.0.0.0  crs.cr.adobe.com  
0.0.0.0  gcos.adobe.io  
0.0.0.0  0mo5a70cqa.adobe.io < ***notice the seemingly random pattern (will talk about this later)***  
0.0.0.0  1b9khekel6.adobe.io < notice the seemingly random pattern  
0.0.0.0  1hzopx6nz7.adobe.io < notice the seemingly random pattern

In this example I'll describe the pop up mechanism of Premiere 2025 which I have not seen in earlier versions and is quite worring.

You lounch Photoshop as an example and it will try to connect to a few dozen domains right away.
Most of them are harmless, and about half of them are capable of triggering a pop up message.

### First mistake with proxy
when you create a rule in proxy to block ic.adobe.io


In [Clash Verge](https://clashverge.net/en/) (available both for macOS & Windows) unlike in other proxy servers, you can use a **_Tun mode_** instead of the regular **_proxy mode_**, which will force all traffic to be routed over Clash and as a result all protocols (not just http & https) will be filtered by the rules you create - this a crusial step to make the filter list published here act as expected!

## Pi-hole

If you want to perform the blocking centrally, instead of Clash as a proxy you can run your own DNS server - Pi-hole is a free solution.

Since version 5 Pi-hole does not support Regex in filter lists, as a consequence it's not possuble to block subdomains via filter lists (imported and updated via URL) you'll have to add the domains to be blocked by hand and click on '**Add domain as wildcard**' button in order to block each sdubdomain too.
...or you install version 4.x and use my pihole_v4_blocklist.txt
