there are 2 major category of hosts:
- with permanent dns names like
  
ic.adobe.io
prod.adobegenuine.com
etc.

- and random-looking dns hosts that are actually generated by a specific alghorhytm and based on experience so far the appearance of these hosts are time-coded, a dozen new appear in network traffic each day like:

pvit0rg7db.adobestats.io
qwidorfrss.adobestats.io
etc.

Blocking 
Premiere 2025 is a great example that blocking these hosts is useless

non DNS based peer-to-peer communication

why is this better than blocking with firewall?
